# House-Price-Prediction
Boston House Price dataset
This project outlines the development of a machine learning model to predict house prices, a common task for aspiring data scientists.  The goal is to construct a Python-based model using readily available libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. The project is structured over seven days, starting with problem understanding and data exploration using datasets like the California Housing Prices Dataset from Scikit-learn or Kaggle.

The initial phase involves loading and visualizing the data to understand the features such as median income, house age, and location, and their relationship with the target variable, house price. Data preprocessing follows, addressing missing values and scaling numerical features. Categorical variables are to be encoded to ensure compatibility with the machine learning model. The dataset will then be split into training and testing sets to properly evaluate the model's performance.   

Model selection begins with Linear Regression for its simplicity and interpretability. The model will be trained on the prepared training data.  Evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score will be used to assess the model's predictive accuracy on the test set. To enhance performance, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV is suggested. The project culminates in documenting the entire workflow, from data handling to model evaluation, in a report or presentation.  Optionally, deployment using Flask or Streamlit is proposed.  The expected outcome is a functional house price prediction model and a solid understanding of the complete machine learning pipeline
